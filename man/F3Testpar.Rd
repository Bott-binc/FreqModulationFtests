\arguments{
\item{xt}{time series}

\item{k}{vector of tapers used in the f test}

\item{p}{Highest degree polynomial you want to test for}

\item{N}{= length(xt)Total number of observations}

\item{deltat}{Time interval between each observation}

\item{dpss}{= FALSE unless you want to use dpss, it will do sine tapers by default}

\item{undersampleNumber}{A numeric of the number the user wants to undersample, usually 100 is a good start}

\item{penalty}{1 is no penalty , 0.2  would give seq(from =  1, to =  1/(0.2*k, length.out = k)
penalty to each respective taper}

\item{R}{= 1 by default: Number of times the specific frequency must be detected to be considered significant}

\item{cores}{must be 1 if on windows, number of cores used for parallelization}

\item{confLevel}{default is 1-1/N, level of confidence used in the Ftest}

\item{returnFTestVars}{= FALSE.  Used for when more information about inner Ftests is needed.
NOTE: this will be very memory intensive and is only implimented for altSig = FALSE}

\item{penaltyOnTapersStdInv}{applys the penalty to all tapers in the calculation instead of just weighting the
eigenCoef's}
